# plunit_assert

Provides a more expressive API for PlUnit by implementing xUnit-like test predicates such as `assert_true/1` and `assert_type/2`.




A longer-term goal is also that it should provide more helpful failure messages.


## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated by PlDoc and the latest is always available here:

https://simonharris.github.io/plunit_assert/

## Installation

Packages are hosted here:

https://packages.pointbeing.net/plunit_assert/

Thus, the library can currently be installed using:

```
?- pack_install(plunit_assert, [url('https://packages.pointbeing.net/plunit_assert/plunit_assert-0.1.0.tgz')]).
```

Once the library is at a more stable release there is a plan to make it discoverable (see [#15](../../issues/15)).
