# plunit_assert

PlUnit is a unit testing library for Prolog. Its goals are:


1. provide a more expressive and familiar API for PlUnit by implementing xUnit-like test predicates such as `assert_true/1` and `assert_type/2`
2. provide significantly more helpful and user-friendly feedback on test fail
3. full compatibility with PlUnit: you can still use  `assertion/1` if you wish


## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated by PlDoc and the latest is always available here:

https://simonharris.github.io/plunit_assert/

## Installation

Packages are hosted here:

https://packages.pointbeing.net/plunit_assert/

Thus, the library can currently be installed using:

```
?- pack_install(plunit_assert, [url('https://packages.pointbeing.net/plunit_assert/plunit_assert-0.2.1.tgz')]).
```

Once at version 1.0.0, plunit_assert will be published and discoverable via `pack_list/1`.

## Examples
```
?- assert_type(3.0, boolean).
[plunit_assert] Asserted 3.0 is of type 'boolean' but got 'float'
false.
```

```
?- assert_equals(3+1, 4).
true.

?- assert_is(3+1, 4).
[plunit_assert] Asserted identity but 3+1 and 4 are not identical
false.
```

```
?- assert_lte(3^7, 6+9.6).
[plunit_assert] Comparison failed: 3^7 (2187) is not less than or equal to 6+9.6 (15.6)
false.
```
